Your team will produce a single write-up document in PDF,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>approximately 4 pages long.&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. In the last paragraph of the report, please write down the names of your team members and contributions from each member.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you work solo, please state so.</p>\n<p>3. In the report, please<span> describe the problem you chose and the methods you used to address it, including which model(s) you tried, how you trained them, how you selected any parameters they might require, and how they performed on the test data. Consider including tables of performance of different approaches, or plots of performance used to perform model selection (i.e., parameters that control complexity). Within your document, please try to describe to the best of your ability who was responsible for which aspects (which learners, etc.), and how the team as a whole put the ideas together.</span></p>\n<p><span>4. The report should be written like a typical conference paper. Do not simply copy/paste your code or results from your terminals.&nbsp; Try to organize it and present it in a neat and coherent format in terms of tables and figures.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>5.&nbsp; There is no presentation for your final project.
